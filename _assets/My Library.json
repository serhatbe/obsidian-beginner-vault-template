It has global catastrophic effects and can be found anywhere from the world's most powerful boardrooms to your local bar. \n\nIt is human stupidity. \n\nCarlo M.

Everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals among us. \n2. The probability that a certain person is stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person. \n3.

  {"id":"clearyTrainingSamuraiMind2009","abstract":"A fascinating, eclectic collection of writings—spanning four hundred years—on samurai ethos, training, and education, from premier translator Thomas Cleary Through the ages, the samurai have been associated with honor, fearlessness, calm, decisive action, strategic thinking, and martial prowess. Their ethos is known as bushido, the Way of the Warrior-Knight.Here, premier translator Thomas Cleary presents a rich collection of writings on bushido by warriors, scholars, political advisors, and educators from the fifteenth century through the nineteenth century that provide a comprehensive, historically rich view of samurai life and philosophy. Training the Samurai Mind gives an insider’s view of the samurai world: the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism had in influencing samurai ideals.The writings deal with a broad range of subjects—from military strategy and political science, to personal discipline and character development. Cleary introduces each piece, putting it into historical context, and presents biographical information about the authors. This is an essential read for anyone interested in military history and samurai history, and for martial artists who want to understand strategy.","author":[{"family":"Cleary","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"clearyTrainingSamuraiMind2009","ISBN":"978-1-59030-721-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,6]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Shambhala","source":"Amazon","title":"Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook","title-short":"Training the Samurai Mind","type":"book"},

  {"id":"denkEveryGoodBoy2022","abstract":"\"In this searching and funny memoir, based off his popular New Yorker article, renowned pianist Jeremy Denk traces an implausible journey. Life is difficult enough as a precocious, temperamental, and insufferable six-year-old piano prodigy in New Jersey. But then a family meltdown forces a move to New Mexico, far from classical music's nerve centers, and he has to please a new taskmaster while navigating cacti, and the perils of junior high school. Escaping from New Mexico at last, he meets a bewildering cast of college music teachers, ranging from boring to profound, and experiences a series of humiliations and triumphs, to find his way as one of the world's greatest living pianists, a MacArthur \"Genius, \" and a frequent performer at Carnegie Hall. There are few writers working today who are willing to eloquently explore both the joys and miseries of artistic practice. Hours of daily repetition, mystifying early advice, pressure from parents and teachers who drove him on--an ongoing battle of talent against two enemies: boredom and insecurity. As we meet various teachers, with cruel and kind streaks, Denk composes a fraught love letter to the act of teaching. He brings you behind the scenes, to look at what motivates both student and teacher, locked in a complicated and psychologically perilous relationship. In his imaginative prose, Denk explores how classical music is relevant to \"real life, \" despite its distance in time. He dives into pieces and composers that have shaped him--Bach, Mozart, Schubert, and Brahms, among others--and gives unusual lessons on melody, harmony, and rhythm. Why and how do these fundamental elements have such a visceral effect on us? He tries to sum up many of the lessons he has gotten, to repay the debt of all his amazing teachers; to remind us that music is our creation, and that we need to keep asking questions about its purpose\"--","author":[{"family":"Denk","given":"Jeremy"}],"call-number":"ML417.D38 A3 2022","citation-key":"denkEveryGoodBoy2022","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-8129-9598-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number-of-pages":"368","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"North Vancouver City Library","title":"Every good boy does fine: a love story, in music lessons","title-short":"Every good boy does fine","type":"book"},

We live ina world full of people with extraordinary abilities. Consider what Roger Federer can do with a tennis ball, or Connor McDavid with a puck. There are chess grandmasters who can play several dozen different games simultaneously--while blindfolded--and a seemingly unending supply of young musical prodigies who would have astonished aficionados a century ago. We are dramatically better at just about everything than we were just a generation ago. We assume, though, that these peak performers are the lucky ones, the ones with a gift. That's only partly true.The fact is we are all lucky. We all have that gift. As Ericsson's whole career has shown, with the proper practice, we are all capable of extraordinary feats. On the surface, the techniques that chess players use to develop their skills seem quite different from the methodssoccer players use to perfect their games, which in turn seem quite different from how pianists improve their playing. But at a deeper level, they are all variations ona single fundamental approach to learning, what Ericsson, a world-renowned researcher, has named \"deliberate practice\": a simple, yet powerful system for enhancing learning. This approach to expertise has the potential to revolutionize how we think about every sort of education and training. We are not limited by an endowment of natural talent. We create our own limits.

  {"id":"goodmanGrowingAbsurdProblems2012","abstract":"Paul Goodman’s Growing Up Absurd was a runaway best seller when it was first published in 1960, and it became one of the defining texts of the New Left. Goodman was a writer and thinker who broke every mold and did it brilliantly—he was a novelist, poet, and a social theorist, among a host of other things—and the book’s surprise success established him as one of America’s most unusual and trenchant critics, combining vast learning, an astute mind, utopian sympathies, and a wonderfully hands-on way with words.For Goodman, the unhappiness of young people was a concentrated form of the unhappiness of American society as a whole, run by corporations that provide employment (if and when they do) but not the kind of meaningful work that engages body and soul. Goodman saw the young as the first casualties of a humanly re­pressive social and economic system and, as such, the front line of potential resistance. Noam Chomsky has said, “Paul Goodman’s impact is all about us,” and certainly it can be felt in the powerful localism of today’s renascent left. A classic of anarchist thought, Growing Up Absurd not only offers a penetrating indictment of the human costs of corporate capitalism but points the way forward. It is a tale of yesterday’s youth that speaks directly to our common future.","author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Blake","given":"Casey Nelson"}],"citation-key":"goodmanGrowingAbsurdProblems2012","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-59017-581-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,11]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"312","publisher":"NYRB Classics","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society","title-short":"Growing Up Absurd","type":"book"},

  {"id":"montaigneCompleteEssays1993","abstract":"Michel de Montaigne was one of the most influential figures of the Renaissance, singlehandedly responsible for popularising the essay as a literary form. This Penguin Classics edition of The Complete Essays is translated from the French and edited with an introduction and notes by M.A. Screech. In 1572 Montaigne retired to his estates in order to devote himself to leisure, reading and reflection. There he wrote his constantly expanding 'assays', inspired by the ideas he found in books contained in his library and from his own experience. He discusses subjects as diverse as war-horses and cannibals, poetry and politics, sex and religion, love and friendship, ecstasy and experience. But, above all, Montaigne studied himself as a way of drawing out his own inner nature and that of men and women in general. The Essays are among the most idiosyncratic and personal works in all literature and provide an engaging insight into a wise Renaissance mind, continuing to give pleasure and enlightenment to modern readers. With its extensive introduction and notes, M.A. Screech's edition of Montaigne is widely regarded as the most distinguished of recent times. Michel de Montaigne (1533-1586) studied law and spent a number of years working as a counsellor before devoting his life to reading, writing and reflection. If you enjoyed The Complete Essays, you might like Francois Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel, also available in Penguin Classics.

Tokitsu has spent most of his life researching the legendary samurai swordsman and his works, and in this book he illuminates this seminal text, along with several other works by Musashi. These include “The Mirror of the Way of Strategy,” which Musashi wrote when he was in his twenties; “Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy,” and “Forty-two Instructions on Strategy,” which were precursors to The Book of Five Rings; and “The Way to Be Followed Alone,” which Musashi wrote just days before his death. Read together, these five texts give readers an unusually detailed, nuanced view of Musashi’s ideas on swordsmanship, strategy, and self-cultivation. Tokitsu puts all these writings into historical and philosophical context and makes them accessible and relevant to today’s readers and martial arts students. Tokitsu understands Musashi’s writings—and Musashi as a martial artist—unusually well and is able to provide a rare insight into the man and his historical contribution.","author":[{"family":"Musashi","given":"Miyamoto"}],"citation-key":"musashiCompleteBookFive2010","editor":[{"family":"Tokitsu","given":"Kenji"}],"event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"978-1-59030-797-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,11]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Shambhala","publisher-place":"Boston","source":"Amazon","title":"The Complete Book of Five Rings","type":"book"},

Adam Smith became famous for The Wealth of Nations, but the Scottish economist alsocared deeply about our moral choices and behavior--the subjects of his other brilliant book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759). Now, economist Russ Roberts shows why Smith's neglected work might be the greatest self-help book you've never read. Roberts explores Smith's unique and fascinating approach to fundamental questions such as:- What is the deepest source of human satisfaction? - Why do we sometimes swing between selfishness and altruism? - What's the connection between morality and happiness?

  {"id":"smithChingBiography2012","abstract":"How the I Ching became one of the most widely read and influential books in the worldThe I Ching originated in China as a divination manual more than three thousand years ago. In 136 BCE the emperor declared it a Confucian classic, and in the centuries that followed, this work had a profound influence on the philosophy, religion, art, literature, politics, science, technology, and medicine of various cultures throughout East Asia. Jesuit missionaries brought knowledge of the I Ching to Europe in the seventeenth century, and the American counterculture embraced it in the 1960s. Here Richard Smith tells the extraordinary story of how this cryptic and once obscure book became one of the most widely read and extensively analyzed texts in all of world literature.In this concise history, Smith traces the evolution of the I Ching in China and throughout the world, explaining its complex structure, its manifold uses in different cultures, and its enduring appeal. He shows how the indigenous beliefs and customs of Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Tibet \"domesticated\" the text, and he reflects on whether this Chinese classic can be compared to religious books such as the Bible or the Qur'an. Smith also looks at how the I Ching came to be published in dozens of languages, providing insight and inspiration to millions worldwide―including ardent admirers in the West such as Leibniz, Carl Jung, Philip K. Dick, Allen Ginsberg, Hermann Hesse, Bob Dylan, Jorge Luis Borges, and I. M. Pei. Smith offers an unparalleled biography of the most revered book in China's entire cultural tradition, and he shows us how this enigmatic ancient classic has become a truly global phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Richard J."}],"citation-key":"smithChingBiography2012","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"Princeton, N.J","ISBN":"978-0-691-14509-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3,25]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, N.J","source":"Amazon","title":"The I Ching: A Biography","title-short":"The I Ching","type":"book"},

  {"id":"suzukiIntroductionZenBuddhism2021","abstract":"No one has contributed more to the amazing interest in Zen Buddhism in the Western world than the author of this volume. Dr. Suzuki has dedicated his life to the subject of Zen, and to interpreting its philosophy and concepts for the Western reader. Of his more than a dozen works currently available in English, An Introduction to Zen Buddhism is most suitable as the basic text for the general reader interested in understanding Zen.After situating Zen both in Buddhism and in Oriental culture, Suzuki then answers the fundamental question \"What is Zen?\" in an incisive, lucid chapter that also refutes several misconceptions common in the West. Continually drawing on his extraordinary knowledge of both Eastern and Western cultures, philosophies, and religions, he illustrates each concept of Zen with concrete examples abounding in wit and wisdom. Zen is not only a philosophy-a way to self¬understanding-it is also \"primarily and ultimately a discipline,\" and Dr. Suzuki gives due attention to the practical aspects of this discipline. More than any other volume on the subject, An Introduction to Zen Buddhism is an indispensable guide to an understanding of this rich, provocative subject.","author":[{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Daisetz Teitaro"}],"citation-key":"suzukiIntroductionZenBuddhism2021","ISBN":"978-1-4341-0476-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,31]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"136","publisher":"Waking Lion Press","source":"Amazon","title":"An Introduction to Zen Buddhism","type":"book"},
  {"id":"suzukiZenBuddhismSelected1996","abstract":"No other figure in history has played a bigger part in opening the West to Buddhism than the eminent Zen author, D.T. Suzuki, and in this reissue of his best work readers are given the very heart of Zen teaching. Zen Buddhism, which sold more than 125,000 as an Anchor paperback after its publication in 1956, includes a basic historical background as well as a thorough overview of the techniques for Zen practice. Concepts and terminology such as satori, zazen, and koans, as well as the various elements of this philosophy are all given clear explanations. But while Suzuki takes nothing for granted in the reader's understanding of the fundamentals, he does not give a merely rudimentary overview. Each of the essays included here, particularly those on the unconscious mind and the relation of Zen to Western philosophy, go far beyond other sources for their penetrating insights and timeless wisdom.What is most important about D.T. Suzuki's work, however--and what comes across so powerfully in these selections--is his unparalleled ability to communicate the experiential aspect of Zen. The intensity here with which Zen philosophy comes to life is without parallel in the canon of Buddhist literature. Suzuki stands apart from all teachers before or since because of his exceptional ability to eloquently capture in words the seemingly inexpressible essence of Zen.","author":[{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Daisetz T."},{"family":"Barrett","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"suzukiZenBuddhismSelected1996","edition":"Reissue edition","ISBN":"978-0-385-48349-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",7,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"400","publisher":"Harmony","source":"Amazon","title":"Zen Buddhism: Selected Writings of D.T.

  {"id":"wattsMyOwnWay2007","abstract":"In this new edition of his acclaimed autobiography  long out of print and rare until now  Alan Watts tracks his spiritual and philosophical evolution from a child of religious conservatives in rural England to a freewheeling spiritual teacher who challenged Westerners to defy convention and think for themselves. From early in this intellectual life, Watts shows himself to be a philosophical renegade and wide-ranging autodidact who came to Buddhism through the teachings of Christmas Humphreys and D. T. Suzuki. Told in a nonlinear style,In My Own Way wonderfully combines Watts’ own brand of unconventional philosophy and often hilarious accounts of gurus, celebrities, psychedelic drug experiences, and wry observations of Western culture. A charming foreword written by Watts’ father sets the tone of this warm, funny, and beautifully written story of a compelling figure who encouraged readers to follow your own weird”  something he always did himself, as his remarkable account of his life shows.","author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"wattsMyOwnWay2007","event-place":"Novato, Calif","ISBN":"978-1-57731-584-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5,12]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"384","publisher":"New World Library","publisher-place":"Novato, Calif","source":"Amazon","title":"In My Own Way: An Autobiography","title-short":"In My Own Way","type":"book"},
